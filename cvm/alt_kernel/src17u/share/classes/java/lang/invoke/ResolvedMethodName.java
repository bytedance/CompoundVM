/**
 * A {@code MemberName} is a compact symbolic datum which fully characterizes
 * a method or field reference.
 * A member name refers to a field, method, constructor, or member type.
 * Every member name has a simple name (a string) and a type (either a Class or MethodType).
 * A member name may also have a non-null declaring class, or it may be simply
 * a naked name/type pair.
 * A member name may also have non-zero modifier flags.
 * Finally, a member name may be either resolved or unresolved.
 * If it is resolved, the existence of the named member has been determined by the JVM.
 * <p>
 * Whether resolved or not, a member name provides no access rights or
 * invocation capability to its possessor.  It is merely a compact
 * representation of all symbolic information necessary to link to
 * and properly use the named member.
 * <p>
 * When resolved, a member name's internal implementation may include references to JVM metadata.
 * This representation is stateless and only descriptive.
 * It provides no private information and no capability to use the member.
 * <p>
 * By contrast, a {@linkplain java.lang.reflect.Method} contains fuller information
 * about the internals of a method (except its bytecodes) and also
 * allows invocation.  A MemberName is much lighter than a Method,
 * since it contains about 7 fields to the 16 of Method (plus its sub-arrays),
 * and those seven fields omit much of the information in Method.
